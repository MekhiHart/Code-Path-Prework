# Prework - *CodePath prework*

Submitted by: **Mekhi Hart Dela Cruz**

**CodePath prework** is an app that... [TODO] 
- Introduces my education and professional background


Time spent: **3 hours and 23 minutes** spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color
 
 
## Additional Features implemented
- Tapping button also changes the font color of labels
- Added 3 additional UIImages to better describe my 3 labels (who I am, my university, and the company I am currently interning at)

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

### My favorite applications
- Linked In
- TimeTree
- Locket

### My favorite features I like from my apps
- Locket: I like that I am able to see pictures sent by my friends, and is displayed on my home screen
- TimeTree: I like that the calendar rendered in the app displays all the events that occurs during that month. It helps me plan out my day accordingly

### An app I want to build
- Name: Food Journey
- Context: I love cooking different kinds of food. But it's hard to keep track of the food that I have cooked previously and get its recipe if I want to cook it again in the future. Therefore I want a repository of the food that I cooked before which can be used as reference if I want to cook the particular food again. 

- Problem it solves & Features: 
--> Saves time of searching for a new recipe if I want to previously cooked food
--> Gives templates of a particular food that I want to cook in case I don't have any ideas
--> Sorts food list based on some score. It renders food starting from the top based on likeness, taste, or some condition (e.g american, japanese, mexican, etc.)
--> Allows user to take a pic of cooked food to give sense of nostalgia, and incentivize to cook that food again if the user wants to cook it again in the future

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I had to the user experience of XCode since there is so much to click on. I most likely lost a significant amount of time manually rebuilding the app for changes that I made in the code which was frustrating not being able to have a hot reload on the app. Another thing is trying to figure out how outlets work; specifically creating an collection of outlets. When I tried to make the labels into a collection, it would always initialize the collection with only 1 element. Figuring that out took some time too. Finally, learning Swift was a bit quirky. TypeScript is my main programming language and I had to refrain using the keyword const to declare a variable instead of let.
